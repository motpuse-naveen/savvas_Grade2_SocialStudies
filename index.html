                    <p>This text set includes three informational texts, a video, and a collection of photos. All deal with aspects of making, buying, or selling products.</p>
                    <p><i><span class="bold">How Does Clothing Get to the Store?</span></i> is the anchor text for this set. Depending on the needs of your class, you may choose to assign <i><span class="bold">How Does Clothing Get to the Store?</span></i> for independent reading, or you may choose to read it aloud with the class. Beginning with the anchor text will ground students in concepts and academic vocabulary that are key to discussing the Big Question. As students read the other texts in the set, they will compare their new understandings, as well as the structure and features of the text, with the anchor text.</p>
                    <p>After students read the anchor text, you may choose to assign specific texts or encourage students to choose the texts that appeal to them the most. Use the chart below to see where specific text features, text structures, and content topics appear across the texts in this set.</p>

                    <p>This informational text explores different bikes, from a simple model to a more expensive electric bike. Photos and details compare the bikes’ features and prices so readers can decide which bike is best.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold uppercase">Big Question</span><br> Remind students of the Big Question: <i>Why do things cost what they do?</i> Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">How do you think <i>Which Bike Would You Pick</i>? will help you think about the Big Question?</span> Ask students what they think a bike might cost, and why.</p>
                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the words <span class="bold"><i>cost, price, </i></span> and <span class="bold"><i>expensive.</i></span> Discuss the meaning of each word with the class. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">If you see an ad for a toy, does it tell you the <span class="bold">price</span>? Do you think a bike is <span class="bold">expensive</span>? What do you think a bike would <span class="bold">cost</span>?</span></p>

                    <p><span class="bold uppercase">Oral Vocabulary</span><br> Some of the vocabulary in <i>Which Bike Would You Pick?</i> might be new or challenging for students. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">A <span class="bold">producer</span> is a person or company that makes something, such as a bike. What is an example of a producer? How might a person <span class="bold">design</span> a bike?</span></p>
                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">K-W-L CHART</span></h3>
                    <p>Share a K-W-L graphic organizer. Explain that this organizer can help students to think about vocabulary words they already know, words they want to know, and words they learn about from the text. Help students practice using a word that they already know, such as cost. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">Do you already know the word <span class="bold"><i>cost</i></span> ? Where would you add that word? What about the word <i><span class="bold">produce?</span></i> If you are still learning that word, where would you add that word to the chart?</span></p>

                    <p>[a three-column chart with columns labeled Know, Want, and Learn. List the following words in each column: <column 1: Know>cost, price<br> <column 2: Want> expensive<br> <column 3: Learn>produce, design]</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Structure</span> Explain that this text has a compare and contrast structure.

Say: <span class="blue_scripting">Both of these photos show bikes. How are they alike? How are they different?</span></p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span> Direct students to p. x. Point out that some words are bigger and bolder than others. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">These big, bold words are headings. They tell what each part of the text is about.</span> Point to the heading “A Bike for Rocks and Trails.” Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What would you expect to read about in this section?</span></p>

                    <p>Discuss the words <i>merchant, need,</i> and <i>want.</i> Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What do <span class="bold">merchants</span> do at a market?

                    <p>Much of the vocabulary in <i>Farmers Market: Meet Me at Third and Fairfax</i> might be familiar to most students, but other texts in this set include words that might be new or challenging. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">A producer is someone who makes or grows something. Who are the producers of the products at a farmers market?</span></p>

                    <p>Share a K-W-L graphic organizer. Explain that this chart can help students to think about vocabulary words they already know, words they want to know, and words they have learned from this reading. Help students to practice using a word that your students will already know, such as <i>toy.</i> Say: <span class="blue_scripting">Do you already know the word <span class="bold">need</span>? Which column would you put that word in? What about the word <span class="bold">merchant</span>?

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Structure</span> Explain that <i>Meet Me at Third and Fairfax</i> has a chronological structure. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">This video shows events in the order in which they happened. The video follows a boy who spends the day at the farmer’s market.</span> Have students watch the first 10 seconds of the video. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What is the first thing that happens in the video?</span> (Possible response: The boy invites the viewer to come to the farmer’s market with him.) <span class="blue_scripting">If you were going to make a video about your day today, what would be the first thing that you would show?</span></p>

At the top of the left column, write “Chronological Structure.” Work with the class to fill in the column with what they know about this structure, and how it helps them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “tells what happens in order”</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span> Explain that the video uses both images and audio to take people on a tour of the market. Have students continue to watch the next 10 seconds of the video (from 00:10 to 0:20). Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">Is that the boy talking in this part of the video? This video has a narrator, or someone telling what happens. You might have read stories that have a narrator. Narrators can also be helpful in some videos.</span> Direct students to timecode 00:40 and have them watch 10-20 seconds. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What is the narrator telling you? How does it help you understand the video?</span></p>
                    <p>Return to the T-chart. At the top of the right column write “Narration.” Work with the class to fill in the column with examples of how the narrator helps readers understand the text. For example: “helps make a topic clearer”</p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Big Question</span></h3>
                    <p>Remind students of the Big Question: <i>Why do things cost what they do?</i> Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">How do you think Shops and Markets Around the World will help you think about the Big Question? What do you think things cost at the shop or market? How do the shop owners decide on prices?</span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the words <i><span class="bold">market, sellers, goods,</span></i> and <i><span class="bold">product.</span></i> Discuss the meaning of each word with the class. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">Have you ever been to a <span class="bold">market</span>? Who were the <span class="bold">sellers</span> at the market? What <span class="bold">goods</span> did they sell? What <span class="bold">product</span> did you want to buy?</span></p>
                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Oral Vocabulary</h3>
                    <p><i>Shops and Markets Around the World</i> includes some words that might be new or challenging to students. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">If you owned a toy store, how would you <span class="bold">display</span> or show the toys? What would <span class="bold">persuade</span> you to visit a shop, or make you want to go there?</span></p>
                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">K-W-L CHART</span></h3>
                    <p>Share a K-W-L graphic organizer. Explain that it can help students think about new vocabulary as well as words they already know. Help students to practice using a familiar word, such as <i>shop</i>. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">Do you already know the word <i>shop?</i> Let’s put that word under Know. What about goods? If you are still learning that word, where would you add it to the chart?</span> Before they read, have students fill in the Know column with words about shops and markets that they already know. They can add vocabulary words they wish to know more about under Want. As they read, ask students to add any new words to the Learn column. A completed KWL chart might look like this:</p>
                    <p>[a three-column chart with columns labeled Know, Want, and Learn. List the following words in each column: <column 1: Know>shop, seller, market <column 2: Want> goods <column 3: Learn> product, display, persuade]</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Structure</span> Explain that  <i>Shops and Markets Around the World</i>  has a compare and contrast structure. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">Sometimes, writers explain how things are the same and different.</span> Direct students to p. 11 of the text. Point out the word <i>both</i> in the caption. Tell students that some words, such as <i>both</i> and <i>like,</i> show that the author is comparing two things, or telling how they are the same. Other words, such as <i>differ</i> and <i>but,</i> show that the author is contrasting two things by telling how they are different.</p>
                    <p>Display a T-chart graphic organizer. At the top of the left column, write “Compare-and-Contrast Structure.” Work with the class to fill in the column with what they know about this structure, and how it helps them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “explains how things are the same and different”</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span> Say: <span class="blue_scripting">This text has a lot of photos in it. Photos can show how things are the same or different.</span> Point out the photo of a market on p. 4. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What does this photo show? What can you buy at this market?</span> Then, direct students’ attention to the photo of a grocery store on p. 6. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">How is this shop similar to the market in the first photo? How is it different?</span></p>
                    <p>Return to the T-chart. At the top of the right column write “Photographs.” Work with the class to fill in the column with examples of how the photos help readers understand the text. For example: “help show similarities and differences”</p>

                    <p>Display these images from <i>Shops and Markets Around the World</i> to help students think about vocabulary words they may have learned from the text, such as <i>goods, display, product,</i> and <i>customer.</i></p>

Ask students to look for words that might have started out in the L (learn) or W (want to know) column that later moved to the K (know) column. For example, if they wanted to know more about the word <i>expensive</i> when reading the anchor text, they might have known this word by the time they saw it in <i>Which Bike Would You Pick?</i></p>
                    <p>Have students identify any words they still have listed as “want to know.” Invite volunteers to share their “want to know” words aloud, and ask other volunteers if they can explain or define the words. Model using reference materials to look up unknown words.</p>

                    <p>An important part of building a vibrant classroom culture is creating an atmosphere in which all
                        students feel empowered to participate in powerful classroom conversation. You may have noticed
                        that
                        your students who are naturally extroverted often participate freely in a whole-class
                        discussion,
                        while those who are more introverted or, perhaps, who come from cultures that respect different
                        classroom norms, may need encouragement to share. You can use sentence prompts like these to
                        invite
                        all students into the conversation:</p>
                    <p>“That’s so interesting … please tell me more!”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone explain that in a different way?”</p>
                    <p>“What are some examples of that?”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone add on to that idea?”</p>
                    <p>Sharing and discussing ideas will often involve agreeing and/or disagreeing with what others say.
                        As
                        students listen carefully and respond thoughtfully to their classmates’ ideas, encourage them to
                        express themselves in respectful and constructive ways. You may wish to post these sentence
                        starters
                        prominently, so students can refer to them often:</p>
                    <p>“I agree, and I also think <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.</span>”</p>
                    <p>“I mostly agree, but <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.</span>”</p>
                    <p>“I like what you just said because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.</span>”</p>
                    <p>“I respectfully disagree because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.</span>”</p>
